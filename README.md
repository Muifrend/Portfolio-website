# My portfolio website
This is my first kind of real website.
## The main page
It has three sections (every section is pretty self-explanatory)
- home
- projects
- skills
## The contact page
It was made just to be, it has no functions.
### Javascript interactivity
1. I made my head rotate when you click it :)
2. On smaller devices there is a dropdown menu
